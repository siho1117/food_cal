# Universal Development Assistant

I will help you with: **{{arg1}}**

## Intelligent Task Analysis

First, let me analyze what type of work this is:

- 🔧 **Refactoring?** (restructure code, extract utilities, move logic)
- 🎨 **Design/UI?** (create widgets, improve layouts, styling)
- 🐛 **Bug Fix?** (find and fix errors, debug issues)
- ✨ **New Feature?** (add functionality, implement requirements)
- ⚡ **Optimization?** (improve performance, reduce bundle size)
- 🧪 **Testing?** (add tests, improve coverage)
- 📚 **Documentation?** (add comments, write docs)
- 🔍 **Investigation?** (understand code, analyze architecture)

## Adaptive Workflow

Based on the task type, I'll automatically:

### For Refactoring/Code Structure:
1. **Analyze** (Sonnet) - Understand current structure
2. **Plan** (Sonnet) - Design target architecture
3. **Execute** (Haiku) - Make mechanical changes quickly
4. **Review** (Sonnet) - Verify quality and correctness

### For Design/UI Work:
1. **Understand** (Sonnet) - Clarify requirements
2. **Design** (Sonnet) - Propose layout and styling
3. **Prototype** (Sonnet) - Build initial version
4. **Refine** (Sonnet) - Polish based on design system

### For Bug Fixes:
1. **Reproduce** (Sonnet) - Understand the issue
2. **Diagnose** (Sonnet) - Find root cause
3. **Fix** (Haiku for simple, Sonnet for complex)
4. **Test** (Sonnet) - Verify the fix works

### For New Features:
1. **Spec** (Sonnet) - Define requirements clearly
2. **Design** (Sonnet) - Plan architecture and approach
3. **Implement** (Haiku for boilerplate, Sonnet for logic)
4. **Integration** (Sonnet) - Connect to existing code
5. **Review** (Sonnet) - Quality check

### For Investigation/Research:
1. **Explore** (Sonnet) - Read and understand code
2. **Map** (Sonnet) - Document relationships
3. **Explain** (Sonnet) - Provide clear summary
4. **Recommend** (Sonnet) - Suggest improvements

## Smart Model Selection

I'll automatically optimize for cost and speed:
- 🧠 **Sonnet 4.5** for thinking, planning, creative work
- ⚡ **Haiku 4.5** for mechanical tasks via Task agents
- 💰 **60-70% cost savings** on average
